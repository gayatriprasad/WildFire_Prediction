# WildFire Prediction
Satellite images of areas that previously experienced wildfires in Canada

The dataset is from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset/data

The idea is to create a classification model to distinguish between wildfire and no-wildfire images. 

I use tensorflow, keras, OpenCV to analyse and model the images. scikit-learn, pandas, numpy are used for data manipulation.
